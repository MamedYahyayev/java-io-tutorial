InputStream

InputStream is an abstract class, it can't be instantiated, it is a base class of all input streams.
InputStream reads data one byte at a time.

read() - this method reads the bytes one at a time and it will returns -1 if there are no more bytes.

read(byte[] b) - this method reads the bytes then will store it in the byte[] array which is b.

read(byte[] b,int off, int len) - this method also do same job, but it will writes value to byte[] array according to off and len parameter
off - this is starting position of byte[] array
len - how many bytes do it read into byte[] array

For example:
inputStream.read(b, 2, 3);
off - 2 (starting position)
len - 3 (how many bytes do it read into byte[] array)
0 0 49 50 51 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


readAllBytes() - this method reads all of bytes in the file, it is faster than other read method, it returns byte[] array

Other methods
available()
mark()
reset()
skip()
transferTo()
